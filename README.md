The number of the data results pictures correspond to the paper.
Figure 6 shows the training process on two GPUs. Figure 6(a) is RTX 2080Ti and Figure 6(b) is Titan RTX.
Figure 7 shows the test BLEU and the test time based on different beam size. 
Columns represent the BLEU scores, and the line connnects the relative train time (relative to beam size=1).
Figure 8 shows the training time (per epoch) when using different batch size on the same device (Titan RTX).
Figure 9 shows the training speed of different devices(CPU and GPUs).
